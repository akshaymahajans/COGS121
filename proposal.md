Name: DiscountWalk (Maybe???)

Summary (140 chars): An app that lets store owners set up flash discounts for customers.  Customers can see these discounts if they are nearby these stores. 

Storyboard: This storyboard is based on Akshay's idea about finding local discounts from milestone 2.

About feedbacks: We got some feedbacks about original storyboard saying that this app idea is very similar to Yelp which also shows cheap restaurants to users. Therefore, we came up the unique feature to our app which is providing users with information about business discounts or sales around your real-time location. Also, our app can remind people about a discount that will end soon. Another feedback we got from milestone 2 is that our app should not only focus on food and we should give users more possibilities. We adopted this feedback to our new storyboard which now shows different kinds of deals in the area. Users can see the discount information about clothes stores, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.

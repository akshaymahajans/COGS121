Name: DiscountWalk

Summary (140 chars): An app that lets store owners set up flash discounts for customers.  Customers can see these discounts if they are nearby these stores. 

Storyboard: This storyboard is based on Akshay's idea about finding local discounts from milestone 2.

About feedbacks: We got some feedbacks about original storyboard saying that this app idea is very similar to Yelp which also shows cheap restaurants to users. Therefore, we came up the unique feature to our app which is providing users with information about business discounts or sales around your real-time location. Also, our app can remind people about a discount that will end soon. Another feedback we got from milestone 2 is that our app should not only focus on food and we should give users more possibilities. We adopted this feedback to our new storyboard which now shows different kinds of deals in the area. Users can see the discount information about clothes stores, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.

Proposed Project Features:
- Display a map of a user's location and any stores near their location
- Allow store owners to broadcast discounts to anyone nearby using this app within the store's radius
- Display to the user a notification of a store's discount if they happen to be within its radius
- Allow users to store discounts they find to their account for later use
- Possibly a search function to see any existing discounts around them

Team Programming Roles:
- Siru: Siru will be focusing on front end development/design of our project, developing the dashboard in which we embed our map interface. 
- Tim: Tim will be responsible for being our resident maps expert. He will be working with the location-based API that we use (Google Maps or Hypertrack), and he will be programming the discount distance feature.
- Prince & Akshay: Both Prince and Akshay will focus on integrating various flash sale API's (https://www.programmableweb.com/api/weeddeals is one example) with the map interface. They will also be responsible for coding out the discount calendar feature.

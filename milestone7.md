This week we have finally decided the main theme of our project which is to help people buy and sell items in limited time period.
And we have created wireframes of the app for the reference of implementation in the future. 
Below are the works done by individuals this week.

Siru:
Created wireframes and made some improvement to the user profile page, including the rating feature.

Prince:
Code the main map interface. Added buy and sell page which allows user to post an item they want to sell and marks the item on the map.

Akshay:
Code the "Sell" page which lets user enter information about the item they want to sell.

#### Overview for milestone9:
* We have implemented the function for users to enter their promotion information which can be saved to our json file for later retrieval.
* Users can now search for the location where they want to post a new promotion.
* Users can see the route/direction for getting to the promotion location from their places.
* Landing pages, login and register pages are created.
* Navigation button is put on the main map page for directing users to other htmls.

* #### Prince: 
  Added routing from user's current location to a marker on the map, and displays directions on how to reach the destination on the right side of the map.  Added searching for a location through Google Maps as a search box so users can find a location without requiring exact coordinates.  In addition to searching, users can now place markers at a location instead of just their current location.

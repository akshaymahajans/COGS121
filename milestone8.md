Prince Le: This is the point of view as a customer, where they can only interact with promotions by buying them.  The user can see an available promotion by clicking on a specific marker in the map or by clicking on the Listings tab in the hamburger menu, which shows all current promotions around the user's area.  The user can also change their login information, view their sales that they saved for later, or view the history of the items they have bought.

Siru A: The prototype is to show the app from a merchant view. After login, the merchant can see the map window where they can learn where their own promotions are and how many business promotions are around them. They can create a new promotion post by clicking the "add" button on the upper right. The menu bar on the left can direct them to other pages including their profile and the page that lists their promotions. They are able to see the status of their promotions by going to the promotion page.

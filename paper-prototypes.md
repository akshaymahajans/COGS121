Description: This paper prototype represents the seller's point of the view of the app by showing how they can add a promotion to one of their stores.  From the main page, after logging in as their company, they can click the Add Promotion button to apply a promo to one of their verified stores, with the ability to choose the item, the discount, and when it expires.  After doing so, they can view all existing promotions they have applied to any of their stores, and they can edit or delete them as they wish.

Description: In my prototype, users can see several sales around their real-time location. On the left side of the screen the sales are ranked according to the distance. Users then can click on one sale to see the detailed information, and if they are interested in this discount they can long press at the button to see the route/direction to get to there.
